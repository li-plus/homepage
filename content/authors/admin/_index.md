My name is Jiahao Li. I am currently a software engineer at ByteDance focusing on high performance model inference framework. Previously I received my bachelor degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I am interested in cutting-edge AI algorithms and infrastructure, including CV/NLP/RL models and distributed training/inference system. It is awesome to make AI accessible to everyone.
